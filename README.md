# BusTracker
Tracks realtime bus locations on a given route and outputs latitude and longitude and bus number.
Works by using GTFS and nanopb to decode.

Input your WiFi information. API key + link + route you want to track. Should work for any transit authority that uses the GTFS system.

Change the INI for your device if using PlatformIO!!
